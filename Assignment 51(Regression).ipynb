    "              variable are a linear combination of the independent variables.\n",
    "2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant. This means that the errors are equally spread out around the regression line.\n",
    "3. No multicollinearity: The independent variables are not correlated with each other. This means that the independent variables do not share any \n",
    "                         common information.\n",
    "4. Normality: The errors are normally distributed. This means that the errors are bell-shaped and symmetrical.\n",

    "1. Linearity: The linearity assumption is the most important assumption for Ridge regression. If the relationship between the independent and \n",

    "2. Homoscedasticity: The homoscedasticity assumption is important for the interpretation of the coefficients of the Ridge regression model. If the \n",

    "                     a test set. The training set is used to fit the Ridge regression model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model. The \n",

    "                as the best value of lambda.\n",
    "3. Theoretical considerations: In some cases, it may be possible to select the value of lambda based on theoretical considerations. For example, if \n",

    "The best way to select the value of lambda depends on the specific application and the goals of the analysis. If you are not sure how to select the \n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some additional details about each method:\n",
